<p class="">Hello, neighbors! Welcome to <em>Fremont Neighbor Notes</em>, a Friday guide to what&#8217;s happening around our community in the coming week.&nbsp;</p>



<p class=""><strong>August 10: A.B. Ernst Park Cleanup </strong>&#8211; Join your neighbors for two volunteer cleanup events at A.B. Ernst Park on Sunday, Aug. 10, and Saturday, Aug. 16, both running from 9 a.m. to noon. The event organizer, Ron Wilhelm, is seeking approximately 15 adult volunteers (18 and older only due to potential hazards) to cut blackberry vines, remove invasive plants, clear garbage and trim shrubs to improve park safety and sight lines. The City of Seattle will provide tools, but participants should wear long pants, long sleeves, closed-toe shoes and bring water, sunscreen and weather-appropriate gear. This community effort will help create a cleaner, safer park while we await the planned redesign and construction of the A.B. Ernst Park Expansion.</p>

<p class="">Fremont&#8217;s dining landscape is undergoing changes &#8212; like always &#8212; as the neighborhood bids farewell to a celebrated restaurant while welcoming new establishments.</p>



<p class=""><strong>The Whale Wins closes after 12 years</strong></p>



<p class="">The Whale Wins, chef Renee Erickson&#8217;s acclaimed Fremont restaurant at 3506 Stone Way N., will permanently close Oct. 28 when its lease expires, according to <a href="https://seattle.eater.com/seattle-restaurant-closings/87296/seattle-restaurant-the-whale-wins-closing-permanently-renee-erickson">Eater Seattle</a>. The restaurant opened in 2012 and earned national recognition, including a James Beard Award for Erickson.</p>



<p class="">Despite its accolades, the restaurant had been losing money for several years as rising costs outpaced sales, according to Sea Creatures restaurant group co-owner Jeremy Price. The closure reflects broader challenges facing Seattle restaurants, with Price predicting more closures ahead.</p>



<p class=""><strong>The Mermaid Lounge opens</strong></p>



<p class="">While Fremont will lose a longtime favorite, the neighborhood is gaining new dining and entertainment options.</p>



<p class="">The <a href="https://www.mermaidloungefremont.com/">Mermaid Lounge</a> opened at 303 N. 36th St. in the old Woodsky’s space with an underwater theme and small stage, operating from 5 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. daily. The venue hosts regular events including Reggae Night every first Thursday featuring DJ Mista Chatman, trivia nights, bingo and participates in <a href="https://www.fremontfridaysseattle.com/">Fremont Fridays</a>.</p>



<p class=""><strong>Caked Goods takes over Simply Desserts space</strong></p>



<p class="">After 40 years in business, Simply Desserts has transitioned to <a href="https://www.cakedgoods.com/">Caked Goods</a>, a Filipina-owned bakery at 3421 Fremont Ave. N.</p>



<p class="">The changeover maintains the location&#8217;s dessert focus while introducing Filipino-flavored cake slices and afternoon tea experiences in partnership with Lola&#8217;s Traveling Tea Party. Caked Goods operates Thursday through Sunday from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m.</p>



<p class="">&#8220;Our commitment to our neighborhood remains unchanged,&#8221; the new owners said, pledging to continue the legacy of &#8220;delicious cakes and desserts that bring joy to your celebrations.&#8221;</p>

<p class="">Hello, neighbors! Welcome to <em>Fremont Neighbor Notes</em>, a Friday guide to what’s happening around our community in the coming week. </p>



<p class=""><strong>August 5: Seattle Night Out &#8211;</strong> Join your neighbors for Seattle Night Out on Tuesday, Aug. 5, as block parties take place throughout Fremont and across the city.

<p class="">Every Friday evening, Fremont transforms into Seattle&#8217;s most accessible music celebration. Fremont Fridays, the neighborhood&#8217;s free weekly summer festival, runs through Sept. 5 with performances across three stages and a community spirit that embodies the area&#8217;s creative character.</p>



<p class="">The festival runs Fridays from 5 p.m. to close, featuring more than 100 local and touring artists at LTD Bar and Grill, George and Dragon Pub&#8217;s all-ages stage, and the new Add-a-Ball indoor venue. The multi-stage format encourages crowds to flow between locations, creating organic connections as families, couples and solo music fans discover new acts together.</p>



<p class="">Local vendors have handmade goods and artisanal foods, while food trucks add to the sensory mix. After 10 p.m., the festival transitions into a silent disco: headphones appear and the party continues in Fremont&#8217;s characteristically unconventional style.</p>



<p class="">Launched in 2021 by Marshall Law Band and Mediums Collective as a pandemic-era gathering space, Fremont Fridays has evolved into what organizers call &#8220;Seattle&#8217;s festival for the people.&#8221; There are no admission fees, VIP sections or barriers between performers and audience.</p>



<p class="">Standing in the crowd on a recent Friday, watching people dance while vendors called out their wares, the festival&#8217;s appeal becomes clear: good music, good vibes and the simple pleasure of community connection without the typical barriers that make live music feel exclusive or expensive.</p>



<p class="">The festival continues every Friday through Sept. 5, with music starting at 5 p.m. No tickets required, just show up and join Fremont&#8217;s weekly celebration. Find more information at <a href="https://www.fremontfridaysseattle.com/">fremontfridaysseattle.com</a>.</p>

Photo by Lydia Heard.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="">Fremont neighborhood residents gathered last Tuesday at the monthly <a href="https://fremontneighborhoodcouncil.org/">Fremont Neighborhood Council</a> meeting at the Doric Lodge to learn strategies for advocating for street safety improvements.</p>



<p class="">Seattle Department of Transportation representatives <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/safety-first/vision-zero">outlined the city&#8217;s Vision Zero program</a>, which aims to eliminate traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2030. The city prioritizes safety projects using crash data and speed monitoring. While high-injury arterials like Aurora receive significant attention, SDOT also responds to neighborhood requests for traffic calming on residential streets.</p>



<p class="">SDOT uses speed monitoring data to identify the most dangerous streets for targeted safety improvements. They’re also developing a Vision Zero dashboard that will track safety progress and show where projects are being implemented throughout the city.&nbsp;</p>



<p class=""><a href="https://ballardfremont.seattlegreenways.org/">Ballard-Fremont Greenways</a> organizers stressed that successful advocacy requires more than individual emails to the city. Residents need to build neighborhood support and engage with community groups like the Fremont Neighborhood Council. The group is also part of the <a href="https://www.got99problems.org/">Aurora Reimagined Coalition</a> working to transform the dangerous arterial into a safer neighborhood street.</p>



<p class="">The BFG’s representatives shared three successful Fremont-area campaigns:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="">They organized businesses and neighbors around <a href="https://ballardfremont.seattlegreenways.org/stone-way-n-safety-improvements/">dangerous pedestrian conditions at Stone Way and 36th Street</a>. After gathering petition signatures and support from local businesses, including Brooks Running and Stone Way Cafe, the city committed to installing crossing improvements.</li>



<li class="">Kevin Troutt documented dangerous striping conditions on the Burke-Gilman Trail through Fremont, generating letters to officials and <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/cyclists-problematic-burke-gilman-trail-intersections/281-349766c5-61c9-4568-905b-2b34010b5157">coverage from King 5 News</a>. His 15-month campaign continues to push for repairs on the popular commuter route.</li>



<li class="">The group&#8217;s signature achievement was the <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/greenways-program/6th-ave-nw">6th Avenue Greenway</a>, connecting West Woodland Elementary School to the Burke-Gilman Trail. The 10-year effort began with neighbors concerned about cut-through traffic and culminated in a safe bikeway serving families traveling between residential areas and Fremont&#8217;s business district.</li>
</ul>



<p class="">For Fremont residents seeking street improvements, you can find more information at <a href="http://ballardfremont.seattlegreenways.org">ballardfremont.seattlegreenways.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="">Fremont Neighbor is launching a new series called “Stone Way Rising” that will take you on a journey through one of Fremont&#8217;s most dynamic corridors. We&#8217;ll walk Stone Way block by block, from the shores of Lake Union up to 45th Street, profiling the new developments, businesses, and changes that are reshaping this historic corridor.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="">As new developments reshape Stone Way, it&#8217;s worth remembering that this bustling corridor’s origins started during Seattle&#8217;s pioneering history.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="">According to this <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2017/11/26/fremont-in-seattle-street-names-and-neighborhood-boundaries/">comprehensive look at the history of Fremont’s street names</a> from local historian, Valarie Bunn, what we now know as Fremont began as William Strickler&#8217;s 1854 homestead claim at the northwest corner of Lake Union. The street grid that defines today&#8217;s neighborhood emerged from the ambitious plans of late 19th century developers and railroad builders. <a href="https://www.writesofway.org/stone-way-n/">Stone Way itself takes its name from Corliss P. Stone</a>, an early Seattle mayor whose nephew Edward C. Kilbourne played a pivotal role in developing Fremont&#8217;s streetcar system and establishing it as &#8220;the center of the universe&#8221; – he made Fremont a transfer point.</p>



<p class="">As Bunn’s <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2017/11/26/fremont-in-seattle-street-names-and-neighborhood-boundaries/">article reminds us</a>, change and growth have always been happening in Fremont. Now it&#8217;s time to see how the next chapter of Stone Way&#8217;s story is being written, one block at a time.</p>



<p class="">Below is Bunn’s article, which you can also find <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2017/11/26/fremont-in-seattle-street-names-and-neighborhood-boundaries/">linked here</a>. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2017/11/26/fremont-in-seattle-street-names-and-neighborhood-boundaries/"><strong>Fremont in Seattle: Street Names and Neighborhood Boundaries</strong></a></h2>



<p class="">Posted on <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2017/11/26/fremont-in-seattle-street-names-and-neighborhood-boundaries/">November 26, 2017</a> by <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/author/valariebunn/">Wedgwood in Seattle History</a></p>



<p class="">Fremont in Seattle began as a planned community after investors purchased the land and filed a plat map in May 1888.&nbsp; A “plat” is any defined area of land for which a plan of lots and streets is laid out.</p>



<p class="">The investors, who were from Fremont, Nebraska, thought that Fremont would be <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2017/11/19/the-fremont-neighborhood-in-seattle-why-the-name/">a good name</a> for this suburb, outside the city limits of Seattle at that time.</p>



<p class="">Before Fremont received its name in 1888, in the 1850s it had been the homestead claim property of <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2018/11/08/william-strickler-in-early-seattle/">William A. Strickler</a>.&nbsp; Strickler was a single man, age 30, who was from Virginia and who arrived in Seattle in 1853.</p>



<p class="">Like other men who came to Seattle in the 1850s, William Strickler worked in Henry Yesler’s sawmill for income while he looked around for a land claim.&nbsp; Strickler located and settled on a claim of 214 acres at the northwest corner of Lake Union.&nbsp; His claim was recorded on February 1, 1854.&nbsp; There was not yet a ship canal, but there was a stream which flowed from Lake Union westward toward Puget Sound.&nbsp; Strickler and other nearby settlers thought they could float logs on the stream and send the logs down Puget Sound to Yesler’s Mill on the downtown Seattle waterfront.</p>



<p class="">In the 1850s William Strickler became an active citizen of Seattle, and he served as a representative in the territorial legislature.&nbsp; Strickler’s most notable achievement was in <a href="http://historylink.org/File/2215">leading the first land survey</a> for Township 25, from downtown as far north as 85th Street.&nbsp; The purpose of the survey was to lay out a grid so that other Seattle settlers could mark their land claims.</p>



<p class="">William Strickler disappeared in 1861, and no one ever knew for sure what happened to him.&nbsp; After seven years had gone by, some men wanted to take over Strickler’s seemingly abandoned property, so they filed a “presumptive claim.”&nbsp; Henry Yesler was Seattle’s Judge of Probate in that year of 1868, so he appointed himself administrator of the estate of William Strickler to protect Strickler’s land claim and seek out heirs, if any.</p>



<p class="">The <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2018/10/15/neighborhood-beginnings-of-fremont-in-seattle-william-stricklers-homestead-claim/">legal disputes over ownership of Strickler’s land</a> claim were not resolved until 1887.&nbsp; For this reason, no one lived on the (future) Fremont property until after the legal issues were settled.</p>



<p class="">Finally in 1887 Seattle attorney <a href="http://historylink.org/File/2610">Thomas Burke</a> sued to force the sale of the Strickler homestead claim land.&nbsp; The motivation behind Burke’s legal action was that he was involved in business and land ventures including a railroad line, a ship canal, and development of other neighborhoods including Ballard.&nbsp; Burke wanted to clear up the lingering legal issues so that he would be able to obtain clear title to portions of the Strickler property where he wanted the rail line to run, and where an existing stream could be enlarged into a ship canal.</p>



<p class="">Thomas Burke succeeded in bringing the issue of ownership of Strickler’s claim property to a resolution by a sheriff’s sale auction.&nbsp; At the auction held on November 19, 1887, Seattle investors Arthur Denny and John P. Hoyt bought the land for the winning bid of $20,641.68.&nbsp; After court costs were paid, about $900 each was paid out to twenty-one heirs of the original homestead claimant, William A. Strickler.&nbsp; Most of the heirs of the estate were nieces and nephews and none lived in Seattle.</p>



<p class="">The investors named the plat the Denny &amp; Hoyt’s Addition to Seattle but they only owned the property a few months before deciding to sell.&nbsp; In March 1888 another investors group, led by Edward and Carrie Blewett of Fremont, Nebraska, purchased the plat for $55,000.</p>



<p class="">On May 8, 1888, the Fremont investors filed a revised plat map but retained the name, Denny &amp; Hoyt’s Addition to Seattle.&nbsp; The new plat map had named streets.&nbsp; Today, some of the streets in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle still have their original names and some do not.&nbsp; A resource for the <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2019/07/15/seattle-street-names-north-of-lake-union/">old and new street names in Fremont</a> is the searchable list created by Seattle historian Rob Ketcherside.</p>



<p class=""><strong>Seattle’s street system</strong></p>



<p class="">Arthur Denny, leader of the Denny Party group of the first white settlers to come to Seattle in 1851, was from <a href="http://historylink.org/File/7875">Cherry Grove, Illinois</a>, where he had been Surveyor of Knox County.&nbsp; With experience in laying out land areas with streets and lots, Arthur Denny filed the <a href="http://historylink.org/File/2026">First Plat of the Town of Seattle</a> on May 23, 1853.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="650" height="662" src="https://i0.wp.com/fremontneighbor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/first-plat-of-seattle-in-1853-e1511072359249.webp?resize=650%2C662&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-651" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/fremontneighbor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/first-plat-of-seattle-in-1853-e1511072359249.webp?w=650&amp;ssl=1 650w, https://i0.wp.com/fremontneighbor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/first-plat-of-seattle-in-1853-e1511072359249.webp?resize=295%2C300&amp;ssl=1 295w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">First plat of the Town of Seattle in 1853.  North is on the left, with the street names beginning at Mill Street (Yesler Way) on the right, present site of Pioneer Square.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="">The plat map above shows Arthur Denny’s first layout of streets, turned so that north is at the left side of the page.&nbsp; The southern boundary of the plat was Mill Street (Yesler Way) on the right side of the page.&nbsp; Front Street (First Avenue) was closest to the waterfront.</p>



<p class="">In planning the street layout, an argument arose with David Maynard, another early Seattle resident, who owned the land south of today’s Pioneer Square at Yesler Way.&nbsp; Maynard wanted to file his plat on a north-south grid, while Arthur Denny, Carson Boren and Henry Yesler agreed to lay out their land parallel to the shoreline of Elliott Bay.&nbsp; This resulted in the elbow-bend which still exists today in the streets which meet at Pioneer Square.</p>



<p class="">David Maynard named the streets in his plat for political figures he admired, who were Democrats of the 1850s such as Jackson and King.</p>



<p class="">In his <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2015/10/10/seattle-street-names/">naming of streets</a> which became the core of downtown Seattle north of Pioneer Square, Arthur Denny chose a scheme of alliterative names beginning with Jefferson and James, Cherry and Columbia.&nbsp; In her book, <em>Four Wagons West</em>, the granddaughter of Arthur Denny wrote, “Why Mr. Denny named the streets in alliterative pairs, no one knows.”&nbsp; (Page 107, Four Wagons West.)&nbsp; When a person files a plat, they are not required to give an explanation of the plat name nor of the street names chosen, so we are left to speculate on the reasons for the street name choices of Seattle pioneers.</p>



<p class=""><strong>Clearing the chaos:&nbsp; Seattle’s first street name ordinance in 1895</strong></p>



<p class="">Seattle did not have any regulation of street names until after the explosive growth of the city following the <a href="http://historylink.org/File/715">Great Seattle Fire</a> in 1889, making it necessary to get better organized.&nbsp; Seattle had grown slowly between 1853 to 1889, but after the Fire a lot of newcomers arrived to get in on the rebuilding of the city. &nbsp; More land areas were platted for residential development and more street names were chosen.</p>



<p class="">To get an idea of the economic boom caused by the Seattle Fire, we can look at statistics for plat filings.&nbsp; It had taken 34 years (1853 to 1887) for developers to create 168 subdivisions in all of King County, with most filed in the vicinity of Seattle.&nbsp; In just three years from 1889 to 1891, more than 400 new subdivisions were filed.&nbsp; (Statistics from page 12, <em>Early Neighborhood Historic Resources Survey Report</em>, see source list.)</p>



<p class="">By the early 1890s some Seattle streets had been extended so that as they passed through different plats, each segment of the street had a different name.&nbsp; Westlake, for example, had four different names between downtown to where it reached the Fremont Bridge.&nbsp; Seattle City <a href="http://clerk.seattle.gov/~scripts/nph-brs.exe?s3=&amp;s4=4044&amp;s5=&amp;s1=&amp;s2=&amp;S6=&amp;Sect4=AND&amp;l=0&amp;Sect2=THESON&amp;Sect3=PLURON&amp;Sect5=CBORY&amp;Sect6=HITOFF&amp;d=ORDF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2F~public%2Fcbor1.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G">Ordinance 4044</a> was passed in 1895 and one of its provisions was to change the name to Westlake along its entire length.</p>



<p class="">Along with many other street name changes, the first Seattle street name ordinance of 1895 included systematization so that a thoroughfare which ran north and south was to be called an “avenue,” and if it ran east and west it was to be called a “street.”</p>



<p class="">Another ruling of City Ordinance 4044 was that streets and avenues in different parts of the city had to have unique names.&nbsp; Up until that time, there were several neighborhoods which had a main street called Broadway.&nbsp; It was ruled that Capitol Hill would keep its Broadway but others, such as Ballard, had to change their main street name.&nbsp; It became Market Street after <a href="http://clerk.ci.seattle.wa.us/~F_archives/annexations/">Ballard was annexed to Seattle</a> in 1907.</p>



<p class=""><strong>Street names in Fremont</strong></p>



<p class="">Seattle’s city street ordinances of 1895 and later, affected Fremont in that we can see that some original street names were not kept.&nbsp; On the original Denny &amp; Hoyt’s plat map of 1888 (below), we see a “Fremont Avenue” which was east-west and so it had to be changed to a street, not an avenue.&nbsp; It is now North 38th Street.&nbsp; Lake Avenue, the original main thoroughfare, was changed to Fremont Avenue because “Lake” had already been used in another neighborhood.</p>

<p class="">On the original plat map called Denny &amp; Hoyt’s, filed in May 1888, the investors, organizers and promoters of Fremont were honored with the street names of Ewing, Blewett and Kilbourne:&nbsp; today’s 34th, 35th and 36th Streets. &nbsp; <a href="http://historylink.org/File/1251">Edward Corliss Kilbourne</a> is the likely namer of many of the original streets in Fremont, because the plat map legal filing info says that he acted as attorney on behalf of the Blewetts. &nbsp; Kilbourne was a nephew of Corliss P. Stone, an early mayor of Seattle.&nbsp; Kilbourne came to Seattle in 1883 to practice as a dentist.&nbsp; Like many others who came to Seattle in early years, Kilbourne soon abandoned his original vocation as he became deeply involved in real estate development.</p>



<p class="">Although his name is not well known in Seattle history, E.C. Kilbourne was very influential as one of the developers of the streetcar system.&nbsp; Immediately following Seattle’s Great Fire of June 6, 1889, Kilbourne took the lead in restoring and extending the streetcar routes. &nbsp; It is partly because of Kilbourne that Fremont became the <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2019/06/11/fremont-at-the-center-of-the-universe/">center of the universe.</a> &nbsp; He made the streetcar routes go through Fremont as a transfer point before turning to other destinations such as Green Lake and Woodland Park.</p>



<p class="">After the <a href="http://historylink.org/File/2707">Stone &amp; Webster cartel</a> gained control of the Seattle streetcar system, in 1910 they constructed the Interurban Railroad which also ran through Fremont.&nbsp; Today that railroad line is commemorated by the Waiting for the Interurban statue at the intersection of North 34th Street &amp; Fremont Ave.</p>



<p class=""><strong>Kilbourne’s street names in Fremont</strong></p>



<p class="">E.C. Kilbourne was from Aurora, Illinois, and he was the likely namer of Aurora Avenue.&nbsp; In the years before <a href="https://www.historylink.org/File/8093">Aurora Avenue was made into Highway 99</a>, Aurora was an ordinary residential street.&nbsp; A remaining segment of “ordinary” Aurora Avenue in Fremont is between North 34th to 36th Streets which is now underneath the Aurora Bridge.</p>



<p class="">In the year 2005 the City of Seattle passed an ordinance to rename this segment of Aurora between North 34th to 36th Streets “Troll Avenue” to help people find the Troll artwork at the intersection of North 36th Street.</p>



<p class="">Some other original names of Fremont streets were probably derived from towns near to Aurora, Illinois such as Albion, Evanston and Palatine.&nbsp; Some of the old street names in the Fremont neighborhood which originally referred to places in Illinois have been changed, such as Chicago Avenue (now called 1st Avenue NW).</p>



<p class="">Just outside of the property boundaries of Fremont, on its eastern edge, was a plat filed by <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2023/01/21/george-boman-in-1890-in-seattle/">George Boman</a> called Edgemont.&nbsp; The name of his original Boman Avenue was changed to Woodland Park Avenue because of a streetcar line from Fremont out to <a href="http://historylink.org/File/1481">Guy Phinney’s zoo</a>.</p>



<p class="">At the south end of the original Fremont plat map are alphabetical streets from Aetna to Florentia.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.writesofway.org/dravus-street/">Writes of Way blog</a> has suggested that these streets might have been named by Leilla, the wife of E.C. Kilbourne, as a tribute to Italy.</p>



<p class="">Leilla Shorey Kilbourne was born in Washington Territory (before statehood) in 1861, the daughter of early white settlers in the territory.&nbsp; Leilla graduated from the University of Washington in 1882.&nbsp; Throughout her life she was involved in women’s clubs with educational programs to help women be well-informed.&nbsp; We may wonder if she ever traveled to Italy herself and if she wanted to remember those sights via the street names in Fremont.</p>



<p class=""><strong>The boundaries of Fremont</strong></p>



<p class="">The original plat of Denny &amp; Hoyt’s included land on the south side of a stream, which was also considered part of Fremont as far south as today’s Florentia Street.&nbsp; It was not until the creation of the present ship canal in 1911-1917 that the south side was separated from Fremont and is now considered a different neighborhood, north Queen Anne.</p>



<p class="">The north boundary of the Denny &amp; Hoyt plat which became Fremont was N. 39th Street.&nbsp; Other people, such as <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2016/01/25/seattles-pioneers-of-fremont-b-f-day-part-one/">B.F. Day</a>, developed land to the north of the Denny &amp; Hoyt’s plat.&nbsp; B.F. Day’s land included the site of the present elementary school and other areas on the east side of Fremont Avenue between N. 39th to N. 42nd Street.</p>



<p class="">The eastern and western boundaries of the Denny &amp; Hoyt’s plat map included the land from 3rd Avenue NW on the west, to Albion on the east (not quite as far east as Stone Way.)</p>



<p class="">To the west of the Denny &amp; Hoyt’s plat was the homestead claim land of <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2016/02/08/seattles-pioneers-of-fremont-john-ross/">John Ross</a>, both north and south of today’s ship canal including the present site of Seattle Pacific University.</p>



<p class="">To the east of the Denny &amp; Hoyt’s plat, was George Boman’s Edgemont and then east of that was a plat called Edgewater.&nbsp; Edgewater included today’s Stone Way and was developed by Corliss P. Stone and William Ashworth.</p>



<p class="">When Thomas Burke and Daniel Gilman succeeded in putting their railroad through in 1887, there were train stations at Ross, Fremont and at Edgewater which was close to the present <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/utilities/your-services/collection-and-disposal/transfer-stations/north-station">North Transfer Station</a> on property once owned by William Ashworth. &nbsp; The railroad route is today’s <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2013/01/01/wedgwoods-trailmakers-the-burke-gilman-trail/">Burke-Gilman Trail</a>, named for the two railroad organizers Thomas Burke and Daniel Gilman.</p>



<p class=""><strong>The process of neighborhood naming:&nbsp; plats, post offices and rail stations</strong></p>



<p class="">When the <a href="http://historylink.org/File/1736">Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern Railroad</a> began running in 1887, stations were established along the way and some of these contributed to the naming of neighborhoods.&nbsp; Stations of the railroad were spaced about one-and-one-quarter miles apart, and often a post office was at or near the same location.&nbsp; In Bothell, for example, grocery store owner <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2013/08/26/gerhard-ericksens-good-road/">Gerhard Ericksen</a> was asked what to call the station since he would be appointed to <a href="http://historylink.org/File/492">receive the mail</a>.&nbsp; He said it should be called Bothell because that family were early residents.</p>



<p class="">In the 1890s as rail stations and post offices began to be established along the north shore of Lake Union, people began to use these as locators and some of them grew into neighborhood names.</p>



<p class="">Plat names were also used for neighborhoods such as Ross, Edgewater and Latona.</p>



<p class="">In the Seattle City Directory of the 1890s, some people listed their home address as “Ross 1st Addition” or “Ross 2nd Addition.”&nbsp; These were plat names of the old <a href="https://wedgwoodinseattlehistory.com/2016/02/08/seattles-pioneers-of-fremont-john-ross/">John Ross</a> property located either north or south of the creek (today’s ship canal), and located west of 3rd Ave NW, the boundary with the Fremont neighborhood.</p>



<p class="">The <a href="http://historylink.org/File/494">Ross post office</a> had been located south of Ross Creek.&nbsp; Its location is now under the waters of the ship canal.</p>



<p class="">Over time, some of the SLS&amp;E rail station names and some plat names were no longer used to define areas, and other neighborhood names rose in popular use.&nbsp; In the 1890s there was a rail station and a post office at <a href="http://historylink.org/File/519">Edgewater</a>, east of Stone Way, and another at the foot of <a href="http://historylink.org/File/514">Latona</a> Avenue on Lake Union.&nbsp; These names fell out of use when the stations closed, and as the name Wallingford rose in popularity for the neighborhood name.&nbsp; No one knows exactly how or why the name “Wallingford” came to predominate, except that the streetcar line up Wallingford Avenue seemed to have given its name to the neighborhood.</p>



<p class=""><strong>Seattle’s neighborhood names and identity</strong></p>



<p class="">In the 1980s the City of Seattle established a Department of Neighborhoods which promoted neighborhood identity, and the present-day <a href="http://clerk.seattle.gov/~public/nmaps/fullcit2.htm">“boundaries” of Seattle neighborhoods</a> were created at that time.</p>



<p class="">Although the setting of “boundaries” of Seattle neighborhoods was arbitrary, the purpose was to help give Seattle residents a sense of ownership and investment in their neighborhoods for involvement in issues.</p>



<p class="">Today’s <a href="http://clerk.seattle.gov/~public/nmaps/fullcit2.htm">boundaries of Fremont</a> are defined as from the ship canal up to North 50th Street, and from 6th Avenue NW to Stone Way.&nbsp; East of Stone Way is the Wallingford neighborhood.</p>

<p class=""><em>A guest post by Zoe R. (9), an incoming 4th grader at Cascadia Elementary School.</em></p>



<p class="">Marmalade is the wonderful, cozy, corner gelato store on Fremont Avenue North and North 42nd Street near B.F. Day Elementary School. Marmalade opened this summer after two years of anticipation from neighbors waiting to see what the new shop would bring. Now, on summer afternoons, a line forms outside Marmalade, with people from Fremont and beyond, bustling to get some of that delicious gelato! On a recent Tuesday evening, Fremont neighbors Zoe, and Dan (her father), sat down to interview Marmalade’s owner, Christopher Yamka, over an Italian soda.</p>



<p class="">Christopher’s connections to the neighborhood and background in restaurant and wine in Seattle  inspired him to open his shop. But Marmalade was under construction for two summers before it opened. The reason it took a few summers was because of many obstacles Christopher faced. One was finances – Christopher ended up as one of only three original business partners to see the opening through. Another was that it took a long time because of the normal processes of getting it approved by the city. Christopher had to cut the floor, he had to tear out every single wall, remove all the plaster, and re-insulate. Everything on the interior had to be gutted and replaced to bring it up to code. During the processes, Christopher got COVID, and still suffers from some long COVID symptoms today.  During the long build-out, Christopher used half-finished Marmalade as a shop. He would come to town, all his tools would be here, get some projects done, then go home.</p>



<p class=""><strong>Menu</strong></p>



<p class="">Marmalade is creating a unique style of gelato, with a northwest version of French and Italian classic recipes. The sorbettos are vegan, with tapioca instead of egg whites. They use local, wholesome, and natural ingredients wherever they can. Christopher says everything is made in-house daily.</p>



<p class=""><strong>History of the building</strong></p>



<p class="">In 1928 the building that Marmalade is today, was built. On one side was a grocery store and a pharmacy on the other side. One long-time neighbor stopped by to tell Christopher that he used to sneak off from B.F. Day to buy RC colas and Baby Ruths from the grocery store as a kid. Another neighbor used to run a dance studio in the building.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1419" height="874" src="https://i0.wp.com/fremontneighbor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/old-Marmalade.png?fit=1024%2C631&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-641" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/fremontneighbor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/old-Marmalade.png?w=1419&amp;ssl=1 1419w, https://i0.wp.com/fremontneighbor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/old-Marmalade.png?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/fremontneighbor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/old-Marmalade.png?resize=1024%2C631&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/fremontneighbor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/old-Marmalade.png?resize=768%2C473&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This is a picture of what Marmalade used to look like before it became your gelato store in Fremont. Images like this are available at https://www.fremonthistory.org/.</figcaption></figure>



<p class=""><strong>Outside and interior</strong></p>



<p class="">Christopher said that when he had gotten the building, the windows were boarded and the building was in poor shape. Christopher also informed us that the little cubes that you see on the overhang weren’t there. So he and his team fixed it based off of the picture of the original building. They tried to make it <em>exactly </em>like the picture. Everything except the color. How the color was chosen was by Christopher &#8212; and one of his business partners who are no longer in the project &#8212;  were challenging each other to see who could come up with the most bold colors that would contrast. The exterior is what Christopher’s partner chose, and Christopher did the interior. The wall paper in Marmalade’s bathroom was the inspiration for the rest. The pink is called Opera in watercolor and Rose Tyrion in oil paint. </p>



<p class=""><strong>Why ‘Marmalade?’</strong></p>



<p class="">The name ‘Marmalade’ wasn’t originally Christopher’s idea. It was his friend James’ idea. One day the two friends were brainstorming ideas, and James thought of Marmalade, and Christopher thought it fit. Marmalade is a kind of Southern treat. James grew up in the Arkansas, and Christopher grew up in Texas, so the two friends were inspired by Southern cuisine, too.</p>



<p class=""><strong>Still expanding</strong></p>



<p class="">Christopher is still working on expanding Marmalade’s stock and entertainment. Marmalade is now selling crepes! And Christopher is considering scooter gelato delivery for the neighborhood. So make sure you’re on the lookout for that. Christopher also has a plan to make the back of Marmalade a place to hold fashion shows, art shows, and even live music. He also will be running the back as a bar. So, make sure you check out Marmalade and its offers frequently!</p>
