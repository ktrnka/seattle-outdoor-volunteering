Your task is to categorize events into one of these categories:
- volunteer/parks: Volunteer activities related to parks, forests, trails, restoration, gardening, or environmental work
- volunteer/litter: Volunteer activities focused on litter cleanup, trash removal, or general cleanup
- social_event: Social gatherings, community meetings, educational events, or networking activities
- concert: Musical performances, concerts, or entertainment events
- other: Events that don't clearly fit the above categories

Return your response as JSON with this structure:

Focus on the primary purpose of the event. If an event combines multiple activities, choose the category that best represents the main activity."""
